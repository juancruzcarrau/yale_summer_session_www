        The form of an analog clock is very familiar to all. A circle, a square, or any shape, twelve divisions with five more in them, and forever constant rotating hands to represent time. Once one's learnt how to read it and wonders what's the time, all it takes is to look at a clock to know what time it is. But do we really "know what time it is"? </p>

        <p>
        The information provided by a clock simply signifies the amount of time that has passed since a designated temporal mark we determined. However what exactly "is the time", what precisely is <i>that</i> instant? To my belief, a moment is so much more than the numerical data associated to it. It is everything that is happening in it, everywhere in the universe.</p>
