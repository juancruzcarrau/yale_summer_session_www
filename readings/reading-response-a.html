    <h1> A Vernacular Web </h1>
<!--    -The amateur web didn't die and it has not disappeared but it is hidden. <br> -->
    -Instead, "Under Construction" images changed their meaning from a warning
     to a promise that this page will grow.<br>
<!--     -Their desire to make the web look like the futuristic
     backdrop of their favorite pieces was justified. Not only
     by their taste but by the hope the new medium was
     offering. The Internet was the future, it was bringing us
     into new dimensions, closer to other galaxies.<br>
     -The early web was more about spirit than skills.
     To distribute was no less important than to create.<br>
     -When the web belonged to amateurs it belonged to the
     people. You knew that behind this page and email address
     was a person you could contact with a question, admiration
     or an insult. And people did.<br><br> -->

     <h1> Vernacular Web 2 </h1>
<!--     -The relationship between ordinary users and the Web of the 90s is a very
     interesting subject to study, because it’s a relationship filled with love,
      hate, all kinds of drama – in other words, it’s a full-blown relationship
      between a new medium and its first users, a relationship that’s exalted,
      complex, sometimes silly – whatever it is, all that matters is that it
      existed.<br>
      -...(home pages) have been replaced by a modest-looking Google start page,
      which wraps itself around every website like a dust jacket.<br> -->
      -At the expense of usability, pages acquire a haunted, immaterial look.<br>
